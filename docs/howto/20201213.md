All you need is to download a client library named **sansi** from koshinto and embed it to your application. Necessary credentials are obfuscated and embedded inside the sansi library, so no need for keys, certificates, license definition files, etc which are confusing, prone to accidents, and can be the target of attacks.

If you remove the SD card, put it on the another Raspberry Pi and run a.out on it, the result is NG without countdown running.

```bash:
ueda@amfortas:~/sansi_examples/c$ ./a.out
NG
```


Your application has successfully refused to start from anything other than your Raspberry Pi board. Now unauthorized copy problem is **no problem** because it **can't be used**.


Notice: In addition to the steps mentioned above, the following setting steps are also available.
- Bind your application directly to an Raspberry Pi Board serial number which you already know.
- Wait for confirm() to be executed, check the value sent, and bind your application to it if there is no problem

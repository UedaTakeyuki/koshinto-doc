# C API of Sansi

int ``confirm``(char *substitutebid, char *secretstring, char *safekeepedkey)  

## return value

- ng_confirmed: The result of confirm is **NG**. Your application should be exited because this is execution on an unintended environment.
- ok_confirmed: The result of confirm is **NG**. Your application can execute because this is execution on an intended environment.
- error_network: The message from koshinto was a timeout. There is no way to know whether on the intentional environment or not, so it depends on the nature of the application whether it is considered a mere accident and generously allowed to execute, or it is considered an intentional network blockage and refused to execute.
- error_internal: Internal error of sansi or koshinto. 
I would appreciate it if you could send me an issue report.

## params
If you just want to check the validity of the execution environment, set all parameters to NULL.

```c
  if (ok_confirmed == confirm(NULL, NULL, NULL)){printf("OK\n");}
```

confirm has three parameters that are effective in a particular situation, as follows:

### 1. substitutebid
A BindID used on behalf of the original BindID of sansi. This BindID should be owned by the same owner of it that the same user who owns the original BindID.

### 2. secretstring
Any string of up to 128 characters passed to koshinto as part of keys. If a string of 128 characters or more is specified, the previous 128 characters are passed.

### 3. safekeepedkey
A pointer to the area that receives the safekeepedkey string returned by koshinto upon successful authentication.  
See [here](/docs/users-manual/binds/safekeeping) for how to set a safekeepedkey on the koshinto.

Following is a sample code of how to get safekeeped key:

```c:
main(){
  #include "sansi.h"

  char safekeepkey[129]; 
  if (ok_confirmed == confirm(NULL, NULL, safekeepkey)){
    printf("%s",safekeepkey);
  }
}
```

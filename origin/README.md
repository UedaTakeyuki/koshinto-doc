# Origin of the name
The origin of the name **koshinto** and **sansi** are from a folk faith[^1] in Japan that had been loved by common peoples until about a century ago, even now we can watch the many remnants as still remained koshin-tower in the historical towns in Japanl, for example, a hill side area of Kawasaki city where I'm living.
